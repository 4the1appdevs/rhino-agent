# Rhino Agent
Rhino is a new/old concept which allows to automate manual tests. Rhino utilize a special freestyle language
of manual tests and uses a sophisticated engine to understand and automate this test.  

Much like other well know spec based languages like Gherkin, each test case is actually a spec which Rhino engine can understand. Unlike other
spec based languages, _**Rhino does not requires you to implement**_ the back-end actions of each spec line as you would have otherwise.  

> Rhino is a pure code-less platform. It does not generate any scripts or building code at the background, it is purely based on the input text.
> Rhino is fully compliant with [WebDriver]("https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/") protocol, utilizing Selenium, Appium and custom clients to interact with the different Web Drivers.  

Rhino API Standalone agent. You can connect your application or Application Lifecycle Manager (i.e. Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.) to Rhino
